\cvsection{Hobbies and Interests}
I am a passionate and curious guy who loves cultivate its hobbies, I like playing the piano (I took lessons for 6 years) and now I am learning to play ukulele. Lately I have discovered a new passion for cooking, I love making pizza, panettone and preparing cocktails, in particular I have a small collection of gins. As a real wine lover, I got sommelier first level qualification. In my free time there's nothing I like more than travelling, I always bring my camera with me to take pictures of the beautiful places I visit (in 2015 I won Liliana Urtamonti photography contest).\\
Sports also play an important role in my life, I practice a large number of sports including skiing, soccer, paddle, beach volley and basketball.
